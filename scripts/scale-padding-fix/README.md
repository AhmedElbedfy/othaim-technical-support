# scale-padding-fix.exe

A JavaScript script that pads number sequences in a file with zeros so that they are all the same length, the script reads the file "scale.txt" and rewrite the data in a format that is easier to parse.

### what problem it solve

The BO app provides data in the wrong format. The update patch won't accept it, so the data needs to be reformatted. This can be done manually or via a script, this script reformats the data to the needed format.

| How it works | The script first reads the contents of the file "scale.txt" and stores them in an array of strings. Then, it calculates the length of the longest number sequence in the file. Finally, it iterates over the lines in the file and pads the number sequences with zeros so that they are all the same length. The padded number sequences are then added to the output. |
